The WiTNY program is made to build up young girls in the technology field. WiTNY stands for Women in Technology in New York.
From our WiTNY program, we were assigned to travel to Gowanus and check out the area. The residents seemed more secluded from the government. We decided that we wanted to regain the trust between the residents and the government, since this area was capable of growth.
