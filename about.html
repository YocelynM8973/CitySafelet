Gowanus is a neighborhood in Brooklyn, New York.This industrial area has began creating new residencies to urbanzie itself. It is a growing community with divided lifestyles. Gowanus residents, especially the elderly and disabled need their voices to be heard so that their needs are heard by the city. 
</div></p>

<div><p>
The WiTNY program motivates young girls to be more involved in the technology field. WiTNY stands for Women in Technology in New York.
From our WiTNY program, we were assigned to travel to Gowanus and check out the area. The residents seemed more secluded from the government. We decided that we wanted to regain the trust between the residents and the government, since this area was capable of growth.

<div><p>
The City Safelet app is intended to be used by all residents, but mainly for the elderly and disabled. The City Safelet bracelet is a device connected to the app, that has buttons easy to access and connects all residents to one another and the city. The functions of the bracelet includes a 311 button, 911 button, a flashlight, an Alert button,a transportation button that uses GPS location, and an update button that informs the user of what is happening around their neighborhood. 
</div></p>

<div><p>
The buttons are all listed in detail on the City Safelet app. All data is collected in the city planning database to further improvements. 
For futher details, please check the app for information on the buttons.
