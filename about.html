<div><p>
Gowanus is a neighborhood in Brooklyn, New York.This industrial area has began creating new residencies to urbanzie itself. It is a growing community with divided lifestyles. Gowanus resisdents need their voices to be heard so that their needs are heard, espcially the disabled and elderly.
</div></p>

<div><p>
The WiTNY program is made to build up young girls in the technology field. WiTNY stands for Women in Technology in New York.
From our WiTNY program, we were assigned to travel to Gowanus and check out the area. The residents seemed more secluded from the government. We decided that we wanted to regain the trust between the residents and the government, since this area was capable of growth.
</div></p>

<div><p>
The City Safelet app is intended to be used by all residents, but focused more on the disabled and elderly. The ImSafe bracelet is a device connected to the app, that contain buttons easy to access and connects all residents to one another. The functions of the bracelet includes a 311 button, 911 button, a flashlight, an Alert button, and a transportation button that uses GPS location.
</div></p>

<div><p>
The buttons are all listed in detail on the City Safelet app and all data is collected in a database.
For futher details, please check the app for information on the buttons.
